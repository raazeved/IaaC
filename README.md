## I - My CTO Life in Datacenters   
By the Way, This is the view of Datacenters in the world for roll out apps on Windows Azure, but when I started was common to implemented internals Datacenters. I faced several challenges before the Internet became a commodity.

## II - IT VDC Entrepreneurship and Startups Revolutions

## There are several Tech and Innovatives Opportunities in the market
There are challenges to decrease time-to-market to roll out yours products, project and serveces in order to improving your Custormers Experience (CX). Follows bellow the PO/PM attention for Digital MVP Funnel.

### 1 - Organizing your Dev Flow for (1) Design Ideas (2) Build It (3)Deploy It (4)review with Clients (5) Add sth more & Run again 

Somehow, your new business model could give back productivity and effectiveness for your code within github|gitlab or Bitbucket depends on your abilities to rollout your idea inside Global Datacenters.

And it's might generating the opportunity to life your apps in the real world and earn some money back advance your family.  

### 2 - MY Datacenter Background - I started in 1992s
       
Despite I'd been a Dev Dbase-Clipper since 1992, I started my IT Tech Professional career in 1994 in Arbame Company in the CPD (1) area, it was working with LABO Cobol Systems.

After two year, in order to deliverying IT expertise with low cost to Arbame I implemented a Datacenter Tier 2 with Novell Server Systems, ERP Protheus, KSR CAD/CAM solutions and MRP II by Datafron Vendor. We faced several changes in the IT infrastructure and Dev SLDC since there (2). In general, We are still dealing with business requests and the necessity to delivery Solutions as fast as we can just improving the business competitivity (3) in the market nw. And It's never stops. Follows below the idea of CRAC rooms.

### 3 - Build and Deliver solutions based on Datacenters 
We noticed that there a mix based on On-premises | Cloud | Hosting | Mobile and IoT, so on. But Shell script from AWS, PowerShell from Azure, generated ability and the oportunities to create a Datacenter more fast then ever. You can release a Virtual Datacenter in minutes.
  
# III- IT VDC Managing and Theorical Basis

## 1 - How IT is Adapting to New Technologies and Hyperconnectivity
Everthing is changing after cloud technology was available, you can increase your squad team produtivity a lot. Take a look on the mindset below, please:

## 2 - Governance with Cobit Process - Service/Portfolio Governance
The Service and Portfolio governance is a unified model across project and services that works in conjunction with the pillar structure that was introduced by COBIT and ITIL in early 2000. The main objective is to ensure that the investments being made in IT are in alignment with the strategic objective of the Businesses.
